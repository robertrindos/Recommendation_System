    "   - Recommendations are given based off the highest similarity scores, in reference to the user's favorite movie.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   - This 'score' gives us a metric to compare similarity to the user's given movie.\n",

    "   - This script was created to be scalable, and even inlcudes a modularized main() function at the end with examples.\n",

    "   \n",
    "   - The count matrix can be trimmed to a desired degree in order to lower the number of computations necessary for the cosine similarity function to occur. The count matrix will be trimmed to only include terms that are seem more than X amount of times in the entire data set. This allows the function to be tweaked for faster processing without sacrificing much accuracy."
